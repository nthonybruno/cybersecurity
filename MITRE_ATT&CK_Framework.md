# [MITRE ATT&CK Framework](https://attack.mitre.org/)

## What is it?
A centralized, public threat intelligence knowledge-base developed and maintained by MITRE. 

They maintain a list of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by malicious individuals and groups who seek to exploit vulnerabilities in the digital space. This list is generated based on real-world incidents, making it a powerful reference for enterprise security teams to pro-actively test and secure.

## What is Threat Intelligence?

It's the process of seeing things from an attackers perspective. What assets does your business have that might interest an attacker? What groups might target these assets? What techniques have they used in the past?

## How is it used?

Red teams can use it to emulate the TTPs used by real world attackers.

Blue teams can use it to proactively develop countermeasures to each TTP.

## Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs)

Tactics: The purpose of an action/objective (ie privelage escalation) 

Technique: The method an adversary uses to achieve the tactic objective. There may be several techniques attackers can use to accomplish a tactic.

Procedure: The step by step breakdown of the technique.
