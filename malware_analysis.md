# Malware Analysis

## What is Malware?
Computer code/software that exploit vulnerabilities in other software from insecure design in aim to cause destruction, block access, steal data or steal money.

Malware use cases include spying (keyloggers, remotely turn on webcam/microphone) or exfiltrate data (steal passwords, confidential documents).

Malware can also be used to encrypt data and demand a payment for decryption (Ransomware).

## [Types of Malware] (https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/malware/types-of-malware/)

1. **Trojan**
- As the name implies, this malware needs a "horse" to hide inside in order gain access to the targets system. This is often done via malicious email attatchments or Microsoft Office Macros. Therefore, this commonly requires a social engineering attack to occur for the initial infection. Then, trojans often remain dormant while trying to spread across the network until triggered by an event like visiting a banking website.
- Uses: Spying, data destruction, data exfiltration

2. **Adware**
- Unwanted software that automatically displays or downloads advertising material, which is how the developer makes money. Often these advertisements are for sketchy websites and services, hence why they rely on illegal advertising tactics.
- Uses: Get unwanted, sketchy advertisements on a users screen. Generally they hijack web browsing sessions and display ads then. 

3. **Spyware**
- Software intended to spy on the user for malicious purposes.

4. **Rootkits/RATs**
- a kind of malware that can give a threat actor control of your computer without your consent or knowledge.
5. Ransomware
- Used to encrypt files to make them unaccessible and demand a payment (ransom) in return for decryption.
6. **Worms**
- Worms are part of the Trojan process used to self-replicate across multiple devices on a network. 
7. **Keyloggers**
8. **Bots**
9. **Mobile**
10. **Wiper**
11. **Dropper**
- Malware used to install other malware. This kind of malware takes care of the initial infection phase. An analogy would be that the dropper malware takes care of initially breaking into your house without you knowing, which can be difficult, and then opens your front door wide open for it's friends to walk right in while you sleep at night.

## What is Malware Analysis?
 Process of analyzing malware to understand it's purpose, scope of impact and signatures to be used for future detection and prevention.
 
Considerations in the process of malware analysis?
 1. How did it initially infect the compromised machine?
 2. How does it hide from Anti-virus software?
 3. How does it interact with memory?
 4. Who/what does it communicate with?
 5. What type of malware is it?
 6. Is it a targeted attack?
 7. What can the malware do? What assets are at risk?

## Types of Malware Analysis
1. Static Analysis: 
  - Process of analyzing malware without execution/running. 
  - Want to find as much metadata as possible which can be used for clues as to it's purpose, scope and expected behavior. 
2. Dynamic Analysis:
  - Analyzing a programs behavior while it is running using a debugger
  - What is the malware doing?
3. Code analysis:
  - Analyzing a programs code. For malware, this involves reverse engineering, as the source code will not be readily accessiblle because it will have been compiled into an executable format.
4. Behavioral:
  - How does it interact with the file system/network while running?
  - Is it establishing any connections? Modifying the registry?
